#### this is reusable workflow so we can use this workflow in other WF 
#### workflow_call is a function is allow us to use this workflow 


### this input is a reserver key word
### artifact-name is user defined
## remaining words are the reserved works where it will used to give inputs where it is called


### This output is a reserved key word 
### results and outcome is a user defined 
## remainig descriptin & value is resverd key word
## The Input and output are called in where this reusable is wf is called In this example we are using in origin_cicd.yaml 
### run: echo "${{ needs.deploy.outputs.results }}" in origin_cicd.yaml
